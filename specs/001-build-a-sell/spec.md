# Feature Specification: Sell-in-Thirds Trading Tracker

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-sell`
**Created**: 2025-09-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a Sell-in-Thirds Trading Tracker web application that helps retail traders implement and monitor the sell-in-thirds trading strategy with breakeven progression stop-loss management. The app should allow users to add stock positions with buy price and shares, automatically calculate sell targets at +50% and +100% gains, manage stop-loss levels that progress from -20% to breakeven as sales occur, and provide an interactive price slider for scenario analysis. Include real-time position tracking, risk management visualization, and a dark-themed responsive interface optimized for financial data display."

   � Identified: retail traders, sell-in-thirds strategy, stop-loss management, position tracking
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � RESOLVED: Session-only storage clarified
   � RESOLVED: Manual price entry clarified
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � COMPLETE: User flow for position entry and tracking
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � COMPLETE: Each requirement is testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   � COMPLETE: Position, Trade, Stop-Loss entities identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   � PASS: All uncertainties resolved
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A retail trader wants to implement the sell-in-thirds strategy for their stock positions. They enter a position with buy price and number of shares, and the system automatically calculates when to sell one-third of shares at +50% gain and another third at +100% gain. As they execute sales, their stop-loss automatically adjusts from -20% initial loss to breakeven protection, helping them lock in profits while managing downside risk.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has no positions, **When** they add a new stock position with symbol "AAPL", buy price $150, and 300 shares, **Then** the system calculates sell targets at $225 (+50%) and $300 (+100%) and sets initial stop-loss at $120 (-20%)

2. **Given** a user has a position with calculated targets, **When** they record selling 100 shares at the first target price, **Then** the system updates the position to show 200 shares remaining and adjusts the stop-loss to breakeven ($150)

3. **Given** a user has an active position, **When** they use the price slider to simulate different current market prices, **Then** the system shows real-time profit/loss calculations and indicates which sell targets or stop-losses would be triggered

4. **Given** a user has multiple positions, **When** they view their portfolio dashboard, **Then** they see a consolidated view of all positions with current profit/loss, remaining shares, and active stop-loss levels

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to record selling more shares than they own?
- How does the system handle positions where the current price is between sell targets?
- What occurs if a user manually adjusts stop-loss levels outside the standard progression?
- How are fractional shares handled in the one-third calculations?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create new stock positions by entering ticker symbol, buy price, and number of shares
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically calculate first sell target at +50% of buy price and second sell target at +100% of buy price
- **FR-003**: System MUST set initial stop-loss at -20% of buy price for new positions
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to record partial sales and automatically update remaining share count
- **FR-005**: System MUST adjust stop-loss to breakeven (buy price) after first third is sold
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain stop-loss at breakeven after second third is sold for remaining shares
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide an interactive price slider for scenario analysis of current positions
- **FR-008**: System MUST calculate and display real-time profit/loss based on current price input
- **FR-009**: System MUST show which targets or stop-losses would be triggered at simulated prices
- **FR-010**: System MUST display all active positions in a portfolio view with key metrics
- **FR-011**: System MUST store position data in session-only storage - data lost on browser refresh, no backend required
- **FR-012**: System MUST accept manual price input via interactive slider for scenario analysis - no live market data integration required for v1.0
- **FR-013**: System MUST implement dark theme optimized for financial data display
- **FR-014**: System MUST be responsive across desktop and mobile devices
- **FR-015**: System MUST validate that ticker symbols are properly formatted before creating positions
- **FR-016**: System MUST prevent users from selling more shares than they currently own
- **FR-017**: System MUST calculate position-level and portfolio-level risk metrics and visualizations

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Position**: Represents a stock holding with ticker symbol, buy price, original shares, remaining shares, sell targets, current stop-loss level, and creation date
- **Trade**: Represents a sell transaction with date, shares sold, sell price, and associated position
- **Stop-Loss**: Represents current stop-loss level with price, status (initial/-20%, breakeven, or custom), and progression history
