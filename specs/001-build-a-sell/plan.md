# Implementation Plan: Sell-in-Thirds Trading Tracker

**Branch**: `001-build-a-sell` | **Date**: 2025-09-17 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-build-a-sell/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → COMPLETE: Feature spec loaded successfully
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → COMPLETE: React/TypeScript web application identified
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → COMPLETE: No violations - simple frontend application
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → COMPLETE: All technical decisions resolved
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Build a client-side web application for retail traders to implement the sell-in-thirds trading strategy with breakeven progression stop-loss management. React frontend with session-only storage, interactive price analysis, and dark-themed financial interface optimized for position tracking and risk visualization.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x with React 18+
**Primary Dependencies**: React, Tailwind CSS, Lucide React icons
**Storage**: Session-only (sessionStorage) - no backend required
**Testing**: React Testing Library, Jest
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)
**Project Type**: single (frontend-only web application)
**Performance Goals**: <100ms calculation performance, 60fps animations
**Constraints**: WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance, responsive design (mobile-first)
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user session, ~10-20 concurrent positions, lightweight calculations

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

The constitution template appears to be a placeholder with no specific requirements defined. Based on general software development principles:

- ✅ **Simplicity**: Single-page application with minimal dependencies
- ✅ **Test-First**: Will implement TDD with component and integration tests
- ✅ **No Backend**: Session-only storage eliminates server complexity
- ✅ **Clear Purpose**: Focused on sell-in-thirds trading strategy only

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project) - Frontend-only React application

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

All technical context items are already resolved. No NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers remain. Research complete with following decisions:

### Technology Decisions
- **React 18+**: Modern hooks-based functional components for state management
- **TypeScript**: Type safety for financial calculations and data structures
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid dark theme implementation
- **Lucide React**: Lightweight, consistent icon library
- **sessionStorage**: Browser-native storage for temporary data persistence

### Best Practices Research
- **Financial Calculations**: Use precise decimal arithmetic, validate number inputs
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels for financial data, keyboard navigation for sliders
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with touch-friendly controls
- **Performance**: Memoized calculations, debounced slider updates

**Output**: research.md generated

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

### Data Model Entities
From feature specification:
- **Position**: ticker, buyPrice, originalShares, remainingShares, sellTargets, stopLoss, createdAt
- **Trade**: positionId, sharesSold, sellPrice, date, type
- **StopLoss**: price, status (initial/-20%, breakeven, custom), progressionHistory

### Contract Design
Session-only application with no API calls. Internal contracts defined as TypeScript interfaces and validation schemas.

### Test Strategy
- Component tests for each UI element
- Integration tests for user workflows
- Calculation accuracy tests for financial formulas

**Output**: data-model.md, contracts/ (TypeScript interfaces), quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (data model, component contracts)
- Each component → test + implementation task pair
- Each calculation function → test + implementation task pair
- Integration tests for complete user workflows

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Types → Utils → Hooks → Components → Integration
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent components)

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

No violations identified. This is a straightforward single-page application with minimal complexity.

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
