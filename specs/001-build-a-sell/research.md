# Phase 0: Research & Technology Decisions

## Overview
Research phase for Sell-in-Thirds Trading Tracker web application. All technical context decisions have been resolved based on user requirements and best practices.

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Frontend Framework
**Decision**: React 18+ with functional components and hooks
**Rationale**:
- Modern hooks API provides clean state management for position tracking
- Large ecosystem with financial calculation libraries
- Excellent TypeScript integration for type-safe financial data
- Strong accessibility support for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

**Alternatives considered**: Vue.js, Angular, Vanilla JS
- Vue.js: Smaller ecosystem for financial tools
- Angular: Overkill for single-page session-only app
- Vanilla JS: Would require more boilerplate for complex state management

### Language
**Decision**: TypeScript 5.x
**Rationale**:
- Type safety critical for financial calculations (price precision)
- Better IDE support for refactoring trading logic
- Compile-time validation prevents runtime errors in money calculations
- Strong union types for trade status and stop-loss progression

**Alternatives considered**: JavaScript, ReasonML
- JavaScript: Risk of runtime errors in financial calculations
- ReasonML: Learning curve not justified for this scope

### Styling Framework
**Decision**: Tailwind CSS 3.x
**Rationale**:
- Utility-first approach enables rapid dark theme implementation
- Built-in responsive design patterns (mobile-first requirement)
- Small bundle size when purged (performance requirement)
- Excellent color palette support for financial data visualization

**Alternatives considered**: Styled Components, CSS Modules, SCSS
- Styled Components: Runtime overhead conflicts with performance goals
- CSS Modules: More boilerplate for responsive financial tables
- SCSS: Less standardized approach to dark themes

### Icons
**Decision**: Lucide React
**Rationale**:
- Lightweight icon library optimized for React
- Consistent stroke-based design fits financial interfaces
- Tree-shakeable imports for minimal bundle size
- Good coverage of financial/trading icons (TrendingUp, DollarSign, etc.)

**Alternatives considered**: React Icons, Heroicons, Custom SVGs
- React Icons: Larger bundle, mixed design systems
- Heroicons: Limited financial icon set
- Custom SVGs: Development overhead not justified

### State Management
**Decision**: React useState and useReducer hooks
**Rationale**:
- Session-only storage eliminates need for complex state management
- Built-in hooks sufficient for 10-20 position tracking
- No server synchronization requirements
- Simpler debugging and testing

**Alternatives considered**: Redux, Zustand, Context API
- Redux: Overkill for session-only data without persistence
- Zustand: Additional dependency not needed for simple state
- Context API: Performance implications for frequent calculation updates

### Storage
**Decision**: Browser sessionStorage
**Rationale**:
- Meets requirement for session-only data persistence
- No backend infrastructure required
- Automatic cleanup on browser close
- Synchronous API simplifies error handling

**Alternatives considered**: localStorage, IndexedDB, Memory only
- localStorage: Persists beyond session (requirement violation)
- IndexedDB: Async complexity not needed for simple position data
- Memory only: Data lost on page refresh (poor UX)

### Testing Framework
**Decision**: React Testing Library + Jest
**Rationale**:
- Standard testing approach for React applications
- Focus on user behavior rather than implementation details
- Built-in accessibility testing support (WCAG requirement)
- Good integration with financial calculation testing

**Alternatives considered**: Enzyme, Cypress, Playwright
- Enzyme: Deprecated, implementation-focused testing
- Cypress: E2E testing overkill for session-only app
- Playwright: Better for multi-browser testing (not required)

## Performance Considerations

### Calculation Performance
**Target**: <100ms for all financial calculations
**Approach**:
- Use `useMemo` for expensive profit/loss calculations
- Debounce price slider updates (300ms delay)
- Pre-calculate sell targets on position creation

### Bundle Size
**Target**: <500KB initial bundle
**Approach**:
- Tree-shake Tailwind CSS classes
- Dynamic imports for non-critical components
- Optimize icon imports from Lucide React

### Accessibility Performance
**Target**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
**Approach**:
- ARIA labels for all financial data displays
- Keyboard navigation for price slider
- High contrast colors in dark theme
- Screen reader announcements for calculation updates

## Financial Calculation Research

### Precision Requirements
**Decision**: Use `Number` type with controlled precision
**Rationale**:
- JavaScript Number sufficient for stock price precision (2-4 decimal places)
- No cryptocurrency micro-penny calculations required
- Rounding to nearest cent acceptable for retail trading

**Alternatives considered**: decimal.js, big.js
- decimal.js: Overkill for stock price calculations
- big.js: Performance overhead not justified

### Sell-in-Thirds Algorithm
**Formula Research**:
- First target: buyPrice * 1.5 (+50%)
- Second target: buyPrice * 2.0 (+100%)
- Share allocation: Math.floor(originalShares / 3) for each third
- Remainder shares: Stay with final position

### Stop-Loss Progression
**Algorithm Research**:
- Initial: buyPrice * 0.8 (-20%)
- After first sale: buyPrice (breakeven)
- After second sale: buyPrice (maintain breakeven)
- User can override with custom stop-loss

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- Ticker symbol format validation (letters/numbers only)
- Price validation (positive numbers, reasonable ranges)
- Share quantity validation (positive integers)
- Prevent XSS through proper input sanitization

### Data Privacy
- No server transmission of trading data
- Session-only storage ensures automatic cleanup
- No user authentication or PII collection required

## Browser Compatibility

### Target Browsers
- Chrome 90+ (ES2020 support)
- Firefox 88+ (ES2020 support)
- Safari 14+ (ES2020 support)
- Edge 90+ (Chromium-based)

### Progressive Enhancement
- Core functionality works without JavaScript (HTML forms)
- Enhanced interactivity with React
- Graceful degradation for older browsers

## Research Validation

✅ All technology choices support the functional requirements
✅ Performance targets achievable with selected stack
✅ Accessibility compliance possible with chosen tools
✅ No unresolved technical dependencies
✅ Security considerations addressed
✅ Browser compatibility requirements met

## Next Phase
Phase 1: Design data models and component contracts based on these technology decisions.
